Distribution of times for each algorithm:

For the 4 tested hull calculation methods, 
Monotone chain was by far the fastest on average
with a high peak dominating the vast majority of runs
before 0.003 seconds, impressively.
Quickhull is the next quickest and then 
Jarvis march and Graham scan appear roughly
