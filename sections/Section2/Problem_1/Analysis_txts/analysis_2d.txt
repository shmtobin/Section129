Distribution of times for each algorithm:

For the 4 tested hull calculation methods, 
Monotone chain was by far the fastest on average
with a high peak dominating the vast majority of runs
before 0.003 seconds, impressively.
Disregarding Quickhull again as it is dysfunctional,
Graham scan appeared to be the next best algorithm
with with a large cluster of runs before 0.0006 seconds
and very few runs considerably slower than this.
Jarvis march was by a wide margin the slowest model.
Its distribution has a peak at around 0.0008 seconds
but a nonnegligible number of runs extend out to 0.0018
 seconds.
