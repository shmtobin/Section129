Time complexity of the four functions:

For the 4 tested hull calculation methods, 
Jarvis march appeared to have the worst time complexity  
which seems decently reasonable. Ideally Jarvis walk is  
O(nh), where h is the number of points on the hull, 
which in theory could be as bad as O(n^2), which is worse 
than Graham scan at O(n log(n)), but this would mean that  
h grows considerably faster than log(n), which doesn't sound  
very reasonable. The most efficient algorithm was Monotone Chain  
which is supposed to also be O(n log(n)). This algorithm is reasonably  
similar to Gram scan, which makes sense since they have common time complexity.  
Looking through my Graham scan, I can definitely believe that it is 
suboptimally designed, so maybe this makes sense.
The quickhull algorithm is broken, and incorrectly selecting the hull
so its results should be wholly discarded.
