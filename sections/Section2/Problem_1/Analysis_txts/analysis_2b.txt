Time complexity of the four functions:

For the 4 tested hull calculation methods, 
Jarvis march appeared to have the worst time complexity  
which seems decently reasonable. Ideally Jarvis walk is  
O(nh), where h is the number of points on the hull, 
which in theory could be as bad as O(n^2), which is worse 
than Graham scan at O(n log(n)), but this would mean that  
h grows considerably faster than log(n), which doesn't sound  
very reasonable. Quickhull was next most efficient, which  
makes sense because Quickhull has time complexity O(nlog(n))  
The most efficient algorithm was Monotone Chain  
which is supposed to also be O(n log(n)), like Quickhull 
so it makes sense their time complexity appears comparable.
